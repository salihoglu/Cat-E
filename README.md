Welcome to Cat-E (Cancer Target Explorer)

Identifying cancer-associated genes and potential drug targets from omics data is a complex task, often requiring extensive expertise and time-consuming analyses. To streamline this process, we introduce Cat-E, a powerful R/Shiny web tool designed for comprehensive analysis and evaluation of cancer-related omics data.

Cat-E, accessible at https://cat-e.bioinfo-wuerz.eu/, consolidates information from various sources including oncolytic viruses, cell lines, gene markers, and clinical studies by integrating molecular datasets from prominent databases such as OvirusTB, TCGA, DrugBANK, and PubChem.

Users can leverage Cat-E's diverse datasets and even upload their own data to perform a wide array of analyses. These include:

Differential gene expression analysis
Metabolic pathway exploration
Metabolic flux analysis
GO and KEGG enrichment analysis
Survival analysis
Immune signature analysis
Single nucleotide variation analysis
Dynamic analysis of gene expression and regulatory network changes
Protein structure prediction
We demonstrate Cat-E's cancer target evaluation capabilities using lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. With its intuitive interface and detailed user manual, Cat-E eliminates the need for advanced computational expertise, making it accessible to experimental biologists, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as oncology clinicians.

Cat-E serves as an invaluable tool for investigating genetic variations across diverse cancer types, facilitating the discovery of novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.
